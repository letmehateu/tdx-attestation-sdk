# Automata DCAP SP1 Project

Leveraging from the [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) project template, we introduce the Automata DCAP SP1 project to perform the Intel SGX / Intel TDX Quote Verification, including the host and guest program.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

## Running the Project

There are four main steps to run this project: build a program, execute a program, generate a core proof, and
generate an EVM-compatible proof.

### Build the Program

To build the program, run the following command:

```sh
cd program
cargo prove build
```

### Execute the Program and Generate the Proof

> [!WARNING]
> You will need at least 128 GB of RAM to generate a Groth16 or PLONK proof if you want to perform the calculation locally.

To generate a proof that is small enough to be verified on-chain and verifiable by the EVM:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release
```

This will generate a Groth16 proof. If you want to generate a PLONK proof, use the `plonk()` method as shown below.

```rust
let proof = client.prove(&pk, stdin.clone()).plonk().run().unwrap();
```

These commands will also generate fixtures that can be used to test the verification of SP1 zkVM proofs
inside Solidity.

Pay attention, if you want to use [Automata DCAP Attestation](https://github.com/automata-network/automata-dcap-attestation) to perform the on-chain verification, we recommend using [dcap-sp1-cli](script/src/bin/dcap.rs) to generate the zkVM proofs with the same Verification Key.

### Retrieve the Verification Key

To retrieve your `programVKey` for your on-chain contract, run the following command:

```sh
cargo prove vkey --elf elf/dcap-sp1-guest-program-elf
```

## Using the Prover Network

We highly recommend using the Succinct prover network for any non-trivial programs or benchmarking purposes. For more information, see the [setup guide](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/prover-network/quickstart).

To get started, copy the example environment file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, set the `SP1_PROVER` environment variable to `network` and set the `NETWORK_PRIVATE_KEY`
environment variable to your whitelisted private key.

For example, to generate an EVM-compatible proof using the prover network, run the following
command:

```sh
SP1_PROVER=network NETWORK_PRIVATE_KEY=... cargo run --release
```
